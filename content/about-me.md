My expertise extends beyond web development to include building custom WordPress themes and Python applications, such as Discord bots.

This comprehensive course covered a wide range of skills, including video and photo editing, business card and logo design, and the fundamentals of website development and design. I also learned to use Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere. For examples of my academic projects, please visit my [academic projects](/#academic-projects) section.
