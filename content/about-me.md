My name is Brett Anda. I am a Full Stack (Web) Developer. I add the parenthesis because I develop websites and other non-web-related projects, including building WordPress websites with custom themes and Python applications like Discord bots. I took my post-secondary schooling at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, where I learned about the basics of building websites and WordPress theming and other new media operations to do with the Adobe suite.

## My academic history

My academic history starts at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) with the [New Media Production and Design (NMPD)](https://saitnewmedia.ca/showcase/showcase-2019/) course, where I learned many things like video editing, photo editing, business card design, logo design, the basics of website development and design, WordPress theming, and more. All of these were taught alongside learning Adobe products like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, etc. To see some of the projects that I made while at SAIT checkout my [academic projects](/#academic-projects).

These are the major things I learned while taking NMPD:
- E-Commerce Sites With HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript
- How to manipulate DataBases with MySQL
- Use a green screen in Adobe Premiere and After Effects
- Websites/Themes using WordPress.
- Build Login pages with PHP sessions
- Landing Pages with HTML,CSS, & JavaScript

## My work history

### True Market

My first job in web development was right after my time at SAIT for the company True Market, and started as a practicum for my last semester at SAIT. During my time with True Market I was tasked with developing WordPress themes for clients. For clients that needed a new wesbite, I would be given a pre-approved design mockup and content, and build out the WordPress theme. Making themes for WordPress makes it easy to go back and change the content of the site within the WordPress back end if needed in the future. To see the projects I worked on during my time with True Market check out my [industry projects](/#industry-projects).

These are the major things I learned during my time with True Market:
- Composer
- Yarn/NPM
- SASS/SCSS
- Webpack
- Laravel Mix
- Vue.js
- jQuery
- SEO standards and better HTML structure for SEO
- Twig templating language

### Conquest Outback Productions

I am currently working for Conquest Outback Productions as a WordPress Developer where I use WordPress and Elementor to build new and modify existing client websites.

## Personal Learnings

Of course I haven't been in school and working every moment of my life. In my free time I have been learning about many more things to do with website development and methods to improve my projects. One of the things I have been learning is Python. Over the last few years I have been self-taught in Python by building [Friday, a Discord chatbot powered by GPT-3](/projects/friday-discord-bot). I have also been learning new website frameworks like VueJS and many more can be found in my [personal projects](/#personal-projects).
