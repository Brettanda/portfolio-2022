I was a student in Calgary at SAIT and took the New Media Production and Design course from Sept 2017 to April 2019. I learned how to make websites using HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and Word Press.

This website acts as a hub for all of my projects that are in development. At the moment it is a single page that shows linked card to the projects that I am working on. This website cannot be found on Google because it is just a testing server run on my Raspberry Pi.
