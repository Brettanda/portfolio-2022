The [Calgary Animal Rescue Society](https://www.calgaryanimalrescue.com/) website was a project I worked on while I was taking the New Media Production and Design course at SAIT. The objective of the project was to find a non-profit organization that could use some help with some form of media. The media we worked on was their website and a re-design of it. 

We remade their website with WordPress as the backend and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the frontend. As we were learning about WordPress theming in our SAIT course, we made the WordPress theme from scratch.
