The Calgary Animal Rescue Society website was a project that I did while I was taking the New Media Production and Design course at SAIT. The objective of the project was to find a non-profit organization that could use some help with media.

This is a project that I have been working on for the non-profit organization Calgary Animal Rescue Society. I have been working on a new website for them that looks more modern. Their current website can be found [here](https://www.calgaryanimalrescue.com/).
