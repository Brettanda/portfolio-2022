[Developer Bacon](https://developerbacon.ca) is a website that I have been developing to help the web development community in a creative way that I enjoy and can have fun with. I chose to make an entire blog website full of tutorials and the solutions to problems that I have run into while on my development journey.

I will continue to post articles for this website for as long as I can because learning new things can take a long time and having the right knowledge the first time makes the expirience a lot more efficient.

When you go onto the Developer Bacon website you are supposed to have fun (well as much fun as you can while on a website). This is expressed through the content and theme of the website.
