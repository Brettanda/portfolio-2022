[Friday](https://friday-bot.com) is an Artificial Intelligence like software that I am developing as a chatbot for Discord. The chatbot system works off of the API from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) using the new ChatGPT model. Friday also comes with community moderation tools, music playback, chat-based games and more. The project is being made with Python 3.8 and Discord.py. 

This project has a public [Github repository](https://github.com/Brettanda/friday-bot/) available.

To talk with Friday in Discord you can mention the bot followed by your message. e.g: "@Friday hey, how are you?" and Friday will respond with something generated by the AI model. e.g: "I'm doing good, how about you?".

Below is a code snippet from the "ping" command that you can run with Friday by using `!ping` or `@Friday ping`.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from discord.ext import commands
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

from functions import embed

if TYPE_CHECKING:
  from functions import MyContext
  from index import Friday


class Ping(commands.Cog):
  """Ping? Pong!"""

  def __init__(self, bot: Friday):
    self.bot: Friday = bot

  def __repr__(self) -> str:
    return f"<cogs.{self.__cog_name__} content=\"Pong\">"

  @commands.hybrid_command(name="ping")
  async def ping(self, ctx: MyContext):
    """Pong!"""
    shard = ctx.guild and self.bot.get_shard(ctx.guild.shard_id)
    latency = f"{shard.latency*1000:,.0f}" if shard is not None else f"{self.bot.latency*1000:,.0f}"
    await ctx.send(embed=embed(title="Pong!", description=f"‚è≥ API is {latency}ms"))


async def setup(bot):
  await bot.add_cog(Ping(bot))
```

Previous versions of this project were written in NodeJS which can be found on my [Github repository](https://github.com/Brettanda/friday-discord-node.js) and C# which was not set up with a repository.

These older versions of Friday even had and older logo, which is displayed below.
