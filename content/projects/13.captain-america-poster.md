This Captain America Poster was made for an in-class assignment where we had to make a minimalistic poster of something that we liked.
The only thing that I didn't make in this project was the stainless steel background which I got from [flickr.com/photos/x1brett/6999852147/](https://flickr.com/photos/x1brett/6999852147/)
