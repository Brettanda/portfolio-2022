## Project Overview

This project was undertaken while I was employed at True Market. My role involved making targeted modifications to an existing website rather than building it from scratch. The primary focus of my contributions was on enhancing user experience and integrating document management solutions.

### Modifications Implemented

#### Image Comparison Slider

One of the significant enhancements I made was on the front page, specifically to the image comparison animation. Initially, the animation would trigger immediately upon page load, regardless of the images' loading status. To improve this, I implemented a JavaScript event listener that ensures the animation activates only after all images have fully loaded. This change enhances the user experience by preventing incomplete animations. You can view this improvement on the [First General](https://firstgeneral.net) front page.

#### DocuSign Integration and Forms Page

During this project, I gained valuable experience with DocuSign, an online document signing platform. I was responsible for creating all forms on the [Restoration Forms](https://firstgeneral.net/forms/) page, which were developed from PDFs and Word documents provided by First General.

I also designed and built the restoration forms page, adhering to the existing WordPress theme and maintaining consistency with the pre-approved design. This involved integrating DocuSign to streamline the document signing process for users, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.
