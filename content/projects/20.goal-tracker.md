Goal Tracker is another Discord bot that I have been building. This project is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/Brettanda/goal-tracker-discord-bot) and is being written in Python with the Discord.py library.

The goal of this project is to help people remember to complete their tasks, by sending them reminders to work on them. You can set reminders to go off at any interval that you need to complete your task(s). To make sure that the reminder will go off at the time you specified, you can also set a Discord server-wide timezone or a user-specific timezone just for yourself. 

For the benifit of everyone, Goal Tracker has builtin localiztion. To check what languages are supported, in Discord you can run the `/languages` application command, and/or to help submit localizations go to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/goal-tracker-discord-bot).
