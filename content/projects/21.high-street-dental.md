I began work on the [High Street Dental](https://highstreetdental.com/) website in 2024 while working with Conquest Outback Productions, taking on the full site development from the ground up using WordPress, Elementor, and YoastSEO. Collaborating with other team members, I incorporated shared design input to create a clean, user-friendly interface that aligned with the clinic's branding and professional image. In addition to the core development, I took the initiative to vectorize their existing low-resolution logo, enhancing its quality for web use and ensuring it displayed crisply across all devices.

Beyond the initial launch, I continue to manage the site, performing regular updates and implementing client-requested changes to keep the content current and relevant. My work also includes ongoing SEO optimization using YoastSEO to help the site perform well in local search results and reach more potential patients. This project showcases my ability to build and maintain a polished, functional, and SEO-friendly website in a collaborative team environment.
