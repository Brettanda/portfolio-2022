I built the [Lion Heart Roofing](https://lionheartroofing.ca/) website in 2024 as a redesign of their existing site while working with Conquest Outback Productions. Using WordPress, Elementor, and YoastSEO, I led the redevelopment from start to finish, giving the site a fresh, modern look while maintaining the core structure and content from the previous version. The goal of the project was to update the design and improve overall usability without requiring a full content overhaul.

The project involved collaborative input from other team members to refine the visual design and user experience. I focused on creating a more engaging, mobile-friendly interface that better reflected the company’s professional image and roofing expertise. I also handled the full technical setup, including SEO improvements with YoastSEO, optimizing key pages to help boost the site’s search engine performance.
