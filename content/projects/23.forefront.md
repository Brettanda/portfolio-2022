I began working on the Forefront website in 2024 while also working for Conquest Outback Productions, a company specializing in both home improvement and outdoor services, including deck and fence building. Using WordPress, Elementor, and YoastSEO, I was responsible for building the site from the ground up, creating a user-friendly and visually appealing design that effectively showcased the company’s services. I collaborated with the client to ensure the site reflected their brand identity, and integrated essential features for easy navigation and functionality.

In addition to the initial site development, I continue to manage and update the website with any client-requested changes, ensuring the content remains fresh and aligned with their evolving business needs. This ongoing work includes making design improvements, adding new service offerings, and implementing regular updates to keep the site running smoothly. My role also involves optimizing the site’s SEO using YoastSEO to ensure it ranks well in search engines and attracts potential customers for the company’s home improvement and outdoor services.
