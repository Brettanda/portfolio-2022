I built the Maxx Construction website in 2023 from the ground up while working with Conquest Outback Productions. Using WordPress, Elementor, and YoastSEO, I developed a visually engaging and functional website that reflects the brand’s bold, hands-on identity in the construction space. The design process was a collaborative effort, incorporating creative input from other team members to ensure the final product met both aesthetic and usability goals.

As part of the visual design, I modified several key images to give them a sticker-like appearance, adding a fun and distinctive visual element that helped the site stand out. I handled every aspect of the build—from layout and responsive structure to content placement and SEO setup. Using YoastSEO, I optimized meta data and keyword placement to improve the site's visibility in local search results.
