The [No Payne Roofing](https://nopayneroofing.ca/) project began in 2022, after the initial build of the website had been completed. I took on the role of maintaining and enhancing the site using WordPress, with Elementor as the primary page builder. My responsibilities included implementing client-requested content updates and making visual adjustments by swapping out and optimizing images to maintain consistency with the brand identity. I also handled the regular publishing of blog posts and podcast episodes, ensuring they were formatted correctly and met accessibility standards. For search engine optimization, I used the YoastSEO plugin to manage and improve the siteâ€™s SEO performance. A significant part of this work involved identifying and removing duplicate focus keywords across separate pages to avoid SEO penalties and improve search rankings. My ongoing work helped ensure the site remained engaging, up-to-date, and aligned with both the client's content strategy and digital marketing goals.
