I joined the [Renovations By Hearth and Home](https://renovationsbyhearthandhome.com/) website project midway through its development in 2022. This became the largest website I’ve worked on so far. From there, I took the lead in completing the build, ensuring a smooth finish using WordPress and Elementor as the core development tools. My role included refining the site’s layout and design, integrating client feedback, and making sure all pages were fully functional and visually aligned with the brand’s identity.

In addition, I handled the SEO setup using YoastSEO, optimizing page titles, meta descriptions, and internal linking structures to improve visibility in search engine results. I also worked on ensuring that keywords were appropriately distributed across the site.

Beyond launch, I have continued to support the client by managing content changes as needed. I also regularly publish blog content to help maintain the site’s activity, boost engagement, and further enhance its SEO performance.
