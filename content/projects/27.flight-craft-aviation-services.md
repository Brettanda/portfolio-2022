I built the Flight Craft Aviation Services website in 2023 while working with Conquest Outback Productions. This project involved creating the entire site from start to finish using WordPress, Elementor, and YoastSEO. The goal was to design a professional and trustworthy online presence that reflected the company's expertise in aviation services.

Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with other team members, incorporating their design feedback to craft a clean, modern layout that effectively showcased the clientâ€™s offerings. I ensured the site was fully responsive, easy to navigate, and aligned with the client's branding.

As part of the development, I also set up and configured YoastSEO to enhance the site's visibility in search engines, optimizing meta tags, page structures, and keyword usage to support discoverability and engagement.
