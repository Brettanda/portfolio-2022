I built the [Smith Bros Floors](https://smithbrosfloors.com/) website, starting the project in 2024 and completing it in 2025, while working with Conquest Outback Productions. The site was developed entirely from the ground up using WordPress, Elementor, and YoastSEO, with a focus on creating a polished, professional platform that effectively showcases the company's flooring services and long-standing reputation in the industry.

Throughout the build, I collaborated with other team members, incorporating their design input to ensure the site’s look and feel matched the client’s vision and branding. I worked on crafting a clean, intuitive layout with clear navigation and responsive design to ensure an excellent user experience across all devices.

As part of the project, I also implemented a full SEO setup using YoastSEO, optimizing page structures, keywords, and meta information to help improve the site's search engine performance and online visibility.
