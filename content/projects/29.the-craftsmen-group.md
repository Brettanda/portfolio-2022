I built the [Craftsmen Group](https://craftsmengroup.ca/) website in 2025 while working with Conquest Outback Productions. This project involved developing the site completely from start to finish using WordPress, Elementor, and YoastSEO. The goal was to create a professional, polished online presence that reflected the company’s expertise and craftsmanship in their industry.

Throughout the project, I collaborated with other team members, incorporating their design input to ensure the site’s aesthetic matched the client’s branding and vision. I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly layout with a responsive design that delivers a smooth experience across all devices.

In addition to building the site’s structure and content, I implemented a full SEO setup using YoastSEO, optimizing page titles, meta descriptions, and keyword strategies to help the site perform well in search engine results and attract new clients.
